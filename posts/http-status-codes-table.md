title: http_status_codes table

I've been doing a lot of web scraping for various AI tools. This includes model training, and search functionality. 
One thing I find myself doing is generating lots of prototypes. 

Each prototype requires me to write a new db schema and one thing they share in common is the need for a `http_status_codes`
table to record the final status response of a web page. You could store the value as an int, or string, or even as json to 
make it queryable. But I feel taking the time to create and populate a table of the status codes is much more advantageous 
for querying and indexing. So to help future Brian I have pasted the code used to generate this table below.

This code is generated by an AI model. Which is a great use for models, as this is just boilerplate.
It would make no sense for me to type this out. Mundane stuff like this is a clear use case for AI.
The overall architecture of the project however is my job.

<magpie-trinket>Run the below script in MariaDB like so `mariadb -u uname -p dbname < http_status_codes.sql`</magpie-trinket>

The below snippet creates the `http_status_codes` table and populates it. I've added a condition on the population
of the data. This is to allow the snippet to be added as a migration, which may be run multiple times. The dialect
used here is for MariaDB.

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS http_status_codes (
    code SMALLINT PRIMARY KEY,
    description VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
) COMMENT = 'Standard HTTP status codes with brief descriptions';

INSERT INTO http_status_codes (code, description)
SELECT *
FROM (
    SELECT 100, 'Continue' UNION ALL
    SELECT 101, 'Switching Protocols' UNION ALL
    SELECT 102, 'Processing' UNION ALL
    SELECT 103, 'Early Hints' UNION ALL

    SELECT 200, 'OK' UNION ALL
    SELECT 201, 'Created' UNION ALL
    SELECT 202, 'Accepted' UNION ALL
    SELECT 203, 'Non-Authoritative Information' UNION ALL
    SELECT 204, 'No Content' UNION ALL
    SELECT 205, 'Reset Content' UNION ALL
    SELECT 206, 'Partial Content' UNION ALL
    SELECT 207, 'Multi-Status' UNION ALL
    SELECT 208, 'Already Reported' UNION ALL
    SELECT 226, 'IM Used' UNION ALL

    SELECT 300, 'Multiple Choices' UNION ALL
    SELECT 301, 'Moved Permanently' UNION ALL
    SELECT 302, 'Found' UNION ALL
    SELECT 303, 'See Other' UNION ALL
    SELECT 304, 'Not Modified' UNION ALL
    SELECT 305, 'Use Proxy' UNION ALL
    SELECT 307, 'Temporary Redirect' UNION ALL
    SELECT 308, 'Permanent Redirect' UNION ALL

    SELECT 400, 'Bad Request' UNION ALL
    SELECT 401, 'Unauthorized' UNION ALL
    SELECT 402, 'Payment Required' UNION ALL
    SELECT 403, 'Forbidden' UNION ALL
    SELECT 404, 'Not Found' UNION ALL
    SELECT 405, 'Method Not Allowed' UNION ALL
    SELECT 406, 'Not Acceptable' UNION ALL
    SELECT 407, 'Proxy Authentication Required' UNION ALL
    SELECT 408, 'Request Timeout' UNION ALL
    SELECT 409, 'Conflict' UNION ALL
    SELECT 410, 'Gone' UNION ALL
    SELECT 411, 'Length Required' UNION ALL
    SELECT 412, 'Precondition Failed' UNION ALL
    SELECT 413, 'Payload Too Large' UNION ALL
    SELECT 414, 'URI Too Long' UNION ALL
    SELECT 415, 'Unsupported Media Type' UNION ALL
    SELECT 416, 'Range Not Satisfiable' UNION ALL
    SELECT 417, 'Expectation Failed' UNION ALL
    SELECT 418, 'I''m a teapot' UNION ALL
    SELECT 421, 'Misdirected Request' UNION ALL
    SELECT 422, 'Unprocessable Entity' UNION ALL
    SELECT 423, 'Locked' UNION ALL
    SELECT 424, 'Failed Dependency' UNION ALL
    SELECT 425, 'Too Early' UNION ALL
    SELECT 426, 'Upgrade Required' UNION ALL
    SELECT 428, 'Precondition Required' UNION ALL
    SELECT 429, 'Too Many Requests' UNION ALL
    SELECT 431, 'Request Header Fields Too Large' UNION ALL
    SELECT 451, 'Unavailable For Legal Reasons' UNION ALL

    SELECT 500, 'Internal Server Error' UNION ALL
    SELECT 501, 'Not Implemented' UNION ALL
    SELECT 502, 'Bad Gateway' UNION ALL
    SELECT 503, 'Service Unavailable' UNION ALL
    SELECT 504, 'Gateway Timeout' UNION ALL
    SELECT 505, 'HTTP Version Not Supported' UNION ALL
    SELECT 506, 'Variant Also Negotiates' UNION ALL
    SELECT 507, 'Insufficient Storage' UNION ALL
    SELECT 508, 'Loop Detected' UNION ALL
    SELECT 510, 'Not Extended' UNION ALL
    SELECT 511, 'Network Authentication Required'
) AS seed_data
WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM http_status_codes);
```

Now if I wanted to link all page responses by status code I can write a query like the one below.

```sql
SELECT pr.id, pr.status_code, hsc.description
FROM page_responses pr
LEFT JOIN http_status_codes hsc
ON pr.status_code = hsc.code;
```
